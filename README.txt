to use:
---for testing purposes - you may run on same computer (localhost) and specify the server as "localhost"---
first run (Server) then either run (Client) or run (specClient) 
run (Client)        --> Onscreen instruction to specify server:port and name
run (specClient) --> server:port and name are hard-coded into the file. (can be changed prior to running)
 
starting a game:
follow the onscreen instructions server-side and pres ENTER when prompted. 3 players are needed to start (it is configurable by editing "run (Server).bat")
